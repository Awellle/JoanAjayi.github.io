Hi there! I'm glad you found me. My name is Joan and I am a Data Analyst

# About me
As a data analyst, I use my skills in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI and Tableau, to analyse data and present actionable insights which help organisations make informed business decisions.I am skilled at gathering data from different sources such as databases, spreadsheets, and more, in order to analyse it to identify patterns, trends and insights that would not be noticed with the mere eyes. I also create visulaisations and reports using Power Bi, Tableau, or Excel, to help understand complex data. Additionally, i can generate reports on key performance indicators, marketing metrics, and other relevant business data. 
My goal is to provide insights necessary to drive revenue growth, improve operational efficiency, and optimise decision making withon your organisation. 
I look forward to working with you!
